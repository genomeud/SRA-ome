These runs, from sheep gut samples in New Zealand, has been executed because belong
to the same study of the run SRR10838683.
After the daily report of the 2021/04/13
the run SRR10838683 has been tested positive to sars-cov-2.
NB: Only one read matched sars-cov-2.

These runs are 2 of the 4 runs which belongs to the same "study", 
having in common almost the whole study title:

Metatranscriptome of sheep rumen microbial communities from Palmerston North Manawatu-Wanganui New Zealand

NB: In SRA database you will not find a SRA Study identifier which matches them all,
because each of them in the database has his own SRA study:

Run         ->  Study       
SRR10837445 ->  SRP155985
SRR10838682 ->  SRP155993
SRR10838683 ->  SRP155998
SRR10838750 ->  SRP155999

So we decided to analyse also the other runs of this study,
excluded the last one (file is so large, >20 GB compressed).
So we analysed SRR10837445 and SRR10838682:
The result is in the file 'researches/searched_2697049_in_field_5.txt',
which is empty: this means all the runs are negative.

NB After a check-up on the positive run we discovered it was just a false positive.
