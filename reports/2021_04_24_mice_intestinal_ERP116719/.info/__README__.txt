These runs are all the runs of that study (run ERR3473671 has been analysed again).
We analysed all of them because:
 - they really few: just 8 runs.
 - the study date corresponds to the period of the start of the diffusion of sars-cov-2.

The results of the analysis are stored in the file:
'researches/searched_2697049_in_field_5.txt'.
In the files there 2 runs which test positive to sars-cov-2:
 - run: ERR3473671, match: 1 reads (obviously, has been analysed again)
 - run: ERR3473664, match: 1 reads
