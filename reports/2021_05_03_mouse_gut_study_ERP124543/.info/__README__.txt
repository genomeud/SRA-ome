These runs are all the runs not yet analysed of that study.
We analysed all of them because they were about 70 and with files have small size.
Although this study has been done one year after the start of the pandemy,
could be interesting to see if sars-cov-2 can survive in mouses too.

The results of the analysis are stored in the file:
'researches/searched_2697049_in_field_5.txt'.
In the files there 9 runs which test positive to sars-cov-2:
 - run: ERR4692025, match: 1 reads
