These runs are not all the runs of that study, 
they are like 400 and some of them files really large.
So we picked random 30 of them.

The file 'researches/searched_2697049_in_field_5.txt' is empty:
this means all the runs are negative.

PS After this analysis we found out that there is a run, ERR3587005,
which belongs to the same BioSample, SAMEA2622249, of the run specified on top.
This run has been executed and its result is negative too.
