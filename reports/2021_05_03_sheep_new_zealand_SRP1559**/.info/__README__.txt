These runs are 2 of the 4 runs which belongs to the same "study", 
having in common almost the whole study title:
Metatranscriptome of sheep rumen microbial communities from Palmerston North Manawatu-Wanganui New Zealand
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=sheep+gut+metagenome%2CMetatranscriptome+of+sheep+rumen+microbial+communities+from+Palmerston+North+Manawatu-Wanganui+New+Zealand

But in SRA database you will not find a SRA Study identifier which matches them all,
because each of them in the database has his own SRA study:
SRP155985
SRP155993
SRP155998
SRP155999
