These runs are all the runs not yet analysed of that study: 
 - run: SRR10016799 has been analysed again (with same results obiviosuly)
 - we checked results of the runs already analysed (all negatives)

We analysed all of them remaining because:
 - the files have small sizes but most of all
 - the study date corresponds to the period of the start of the diffusion of sars-cov-2.

The results of the analysis are stored in the files:
'2021_04_29_feces_california_study_SRP219167/researches/searched_2697049_in_field_5.txt'
'2021_04_29_feces_california_sample_SRS5303994/researches/searched_2697049_in_field_5.txt'
