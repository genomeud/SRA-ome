NB:
These two runs gave error because in SRA they are marked as 'SINGLE', but in reality their layout is 'PAIRED': 
infact both of them after fasterq-dump produced 2 fastq files.
Now we will make a notice to SRA, but in reality the analysis went good without any problem
So we will save them with an OK and not ERR. 

SRR9860477,OK
