<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Although rising ocean temperatures threaten scleractinian corals and the reefs they construct, certain reef corals can acclimate to elevated temperatures to which they are rarely exposed in situ. Specimens of the Indo-Pacific reef coral Pocillopora damicornis collected from upwelling reefs of Southern Taiwan were previously found to have survived a 36-week exposure to 30&#xB0;C, a temperature they encounter infrequently and one that elicits the breakdown of the coral-dinoflagellate (genus Symbiodinium) endosymbiosis in many corals of the Pacific Ocean. In order to gain insight into the sub-cellular pathways utilized by both the coral hosts and their mutualistic Symbiodinium populations to acclimate to this temperature, mRNAs from both control (27&#xB0;C) and high (30&#xB0;C) temperature samples were sequenced on an Illumina platform and assembled into a 236,435-contig transcriptome. These P. damicornis specimens were found to be ~60% anthozoan and 40% microbe (Symbiodinium, other eukaryotic microbes, and bacteria), from an mRNA-perspective. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of genes from the Symbiodinium compartment were differentially expressed after two weeks of exposure. Specifically, Symbiodinium populations residing within the coral gastrodermal tissues were more likely to up-regulate genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism, while the host coral was more likely to down-regulate the expression of metabolism-targeted genes. Collectively, these transcriptome-scale data suggest that the two members of this endosymbiosis have distinct strategies for acclimating to elevated temperatures that are expected to characterize many of Earth&#x2019;s coral reefs in the coming decades.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Ananas comosus var. bracteatus is cultivated commercially as an ornamental plant because of its colorful chimera leaves. The chimera leaves consist of normal green cells and albino white cells. Of note, the chimeric character of the leaves in cultivated plants is not stable. We undertook transcriptome sequencing of the complete green cells (CGr) and the complete white cells (CWh), provided a frame of transcription variations between CGr and CWh plants that most likely result in the development of albino leaf cells. Small RNA libraries were constructed at different developmental stages of CWh and CGr leaves to elucidate the functional and regulatory roles of miRNAs in the development of albino cells in leaves of A. comosus var. bracteatus.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Approximately 0.25 grams of each sample underwent RNA extraction using the RNeasy PowerMicrobiome Kit (Qiagen). The RNeasy PowerMicrobiome kit utilizes a cell lysis protocol that is similar to the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit, which relies on the addition of each sample to a beaded tube in combination with Lysis buffer (Solution PM1/- mercaptoethanol), and were subsequently vortexed within the Disruptor Genie for 10 minutes. All RNA extracts were quantified using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to confirm complete DNase treatment of the RNA extracts (DNA concentration &lt;0.05 ng/uL). Subsequently, approximately 100 ng of extracted RNA was subjected to NuGEN Ovation (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA, USA) double stranded cDNA synthesis and metatranscriptome library preparation. Quality of the final library was assessed using a high sensitivity bioanalyzer chip (Agilent). The same library quantification, pooling, and purification methods were used as described above. Purified metatranscriptome libraries underwent sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq4000 following a 2 x 150bp index run</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Approximately 100-150 mg of fecal material were used to extract total RNA with the Quick-RNA Fecal/Soil Microprep Kit (Zymo Research, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions and including the optional in-column DNase I digestion step to eliminate any traces of leftover DNA. For each stool sample, a sequencing library was first constructed using the Truseq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) with the following modifications: The oligo-dT mRNA purification step was omitted and instead, 200ng of total RNA were directly added to the Elution2-Frag-Prime step. The PCR amplification step, which selectively enriches for library fragments that have adapters ligated at both ends, was performed according to the manufacturers recommendation but the number of amplification cycles was reduced to 12 instead of 15. Each library was uniquely tagged with one of Illuminas TruSeq HT RNA barcode combinations to enable sample pooling for sequencing. Finished libraries were quantitated using Promegas QuantiFluor dsDNA assay and the average library size was determined on an Agilent Tapestation 4200. Library concentrations were then normalized to 4nM and validated by qPCR on a QuantStudio-3 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), using the Kapa library quantification kit for Illumina platforms (Kapa Biosystems). The libraries were then pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer in rapid mode</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>cDNA created using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) was used to amplify the archaeal and bacterial V4-5 hypervariable region of the SSU rRNA gene using the forward primers CS1_515F-Y (ACACTGACGACATGGTTCTACA_GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and reverse primers CS2_926R (TACGGTAGCAGAGACTTGGTCT_CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) primers. Prior to reverse transcription, all RNA samples were tested by PCR for the presence of contaminating DNA. PCR amplicons were generated in triplicate 25 l volumes containing 0.5 ng of template, 12.5 l of MyTaq Red Mix (Bioline), 0.5 l of 10 M of each primer. All PCR products were validated on 1% agarose gels and then triplicates were pooled. Four negative controls without template were run in the PCR and sequenced in parallel. A unique 10-base barcode, obtained from the Access Array Barcode Library for Illumina (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA; Item# 100-4876), were added to samples in a second PCR amplification using the MyTaq HS 2X mastermix and 10 l reaction volumes. Samples were pooled in equal volume. The pooled library was purified using an AMPure XP cleanup protocol (0.6X, vol/vol; Agencourt, Beckmann-Coulter) and sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output flow cell (2x150 paired-end reads). Based on the distribution of reads per barcode, the amplicons (before purification) were re-pooled to generate a more balanced distribution of reads. The re-pooled library was purified using AMPure XP cleanup, loaded onto a MiSeq v2 flow cell, and sequenced on an an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (2x250 paired-end reads). Sequence library preparation, pooling, and MiniSeq sequencing were performed at the DNA Services (DNAS) facility, Research Resources Center (RRC), University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). MiSeq sequencing was performed at the W.M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>cDNA Libraries preparation and sequencing Total RNA was rRNA depleted using Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit Bacteria (Illumina) and cDNA libraries were obtained following Illumina's recommendations. We started from 2 g of total RNA (RIN&gt;9) libraries. Briefly, RNA ribosomal depleted was chemically fragmented prior to reverse transcription and cDNA generation. The cDNA fragments then went through an end repair process, the addition of a single 'A' base to the 3' end and then ligation of the adapters. Finally, the products were purified and enriched with PCR to create the indexed final double stranded cDNA library. The quality of the libraries was analyzed in TapeStation 4200, High Sensitivity assay; the quantity of the libraries was determined by real-time PCR in LightCycler 480 (Roche).

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>"Double stranded cDNA libraries were paired-end sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq (Campus Science Support Facilities GmbH, Vienna). Read pairs were overlapped using FLASH, which yielded reads of approx. 170 bp (Mago? and Salzberg, 2011). Metatranscriptomic sequencing data were analyzed following an established double RNA analysis pipeline (Urich et al., 2008). Approximately 95% of the reads per sample were derived from rRNA; the number of putative mRNA reads per sample ranged from 75,305 to 1,166,930 . Community composition was determined from 100,000 randomly chosen rRNA reads per sample, which were taxonomically assigned using CREST (Lanz?n et al., 2012) (bit score=150, top percent=10, minimal support=5). mRNA tags were compared against the NCBI RefSeq database using BlastX and functionally and taxonomically classified using MEGAN and the SEED functional classification scheme therein (bit score=40, top percent=10, minimal support=1) (Mitra et al., 2011). This resulted in 24,190 to 368,950 functionally annotated mRNAs. Metatranscriptomes were generated from three replicates collected on days 1, 5, and 14 and from four replicates collected on days 8 and 25."</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Double-stranded cDNA was fed into Illumina s TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol at the  adenylate 3  ends  step. Twelve-cycle PCR amplification was performed to enrich the library fragments with adapters on both ends. Each library was uniquely tagged with one of Illumina s TruSeq LT RNA barcodes to enable library pooling for sequencing. The finished libraries were quantitated using Invitrogen s Picogreen assay and the average library size was determined on a Bioanalyzer 2100, using a DNA 7500 chip (Agilent). Library concentrations were then normalized to 4nM and validated by qPCR on a ViiA-7 real-time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), using qPCR primers recommended in Illumina s qPCR protocol, and Illumina s PhiX control library as standard. The libraries were then pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer in rapid mode at a read-length of 100 bp paired-end.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Filtered seawater samples were homogenized for 2 min in TE buffer (1mM EDTA, 10mM Tris; pH 6.3) with ~1g of sterilized 0.1mm diameter zirconia/silica beads. After bead beating, crude extracts were amended with two volumes of chilled (4) denaturing buffer (4M guanidine thiocyanate, 50mM Tris, 10mM EDTA, 1% w/v N-lauroylsarcosine, 1% ?-mercaptoethanol) and pelleted via centrifugation (4500xg for 5 min at 4). The resulting supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 6.6), followed by a second extraction with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Nucleic acids were purified from these extracts via an overnight isopropanol precipitation with 3M sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and a subsequent 70% ethanol wash, followed by resuspension in 100 of TE buffer. Genomic DNA was eliminated from RNA samples with TURBO DNAse (Ambion) followed by purification with MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up kits (Ambion). The resulting purified total RNA extracts were processed with MICROBExpress kits (Ambion) to reduce the amount of 16S and 23S rRNA transcripts within the samples and then sent to the University of Delaware DNA Sequencing &amp; Genotyping Center (Newark, DE, USA) for Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing (SINGLE-end 150bp reads).</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Filters from triplicate bottles, representing approximately 6 L of water, were pooled by treatment and extracted for each of the in situ and incubation experiment samples.

Libraries were sequenced at the Columbia University Genome Center (New York, New York) with an Illumina HiSeq2000. Each sample was sequenced to produce ~ 60 million, 100 base pair, paired end reads (Supplemental Table 1). Raw sequence data quality was visualized using FastQC and then cleaned and trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.27 (paired end mode; 6-base pair wide sliding window for quality below 20; minimum length 25 base pair) (74). Environmental sequence reads are available at the NCBI SRA (accession number pending).</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>From Rivers et al. 2013: "RNA was extracted according to Poretsky et al. (2009). Six internal RNA standards (artificial mRNAs synthesized by in vitro transcription of DNA templates) were added as internal controls (1.4 _ 1010 transcripts per sample) (Satinsky et al., 2013). The two smallest standards (~200_nt) were not appreciably recovered on the solid phase extraction matrix used for RNA purification and were not considered further. RNA extracts were depleted of rRNA by creating sample-specific removal probes targeting the large and small subunits of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic rRNA genes using the DNA of each sample (Stewart et al., 2010). The protocol was modified by pooling probes from multiple DNA samples (see below) and including an additional round of probe removal. rRNA-depleted mRNA was amplified using the MessageAmp II bacterial kit (Life Technologies) and complementary DNA was synthesized using the universal Riboclone complementary DNA synthesis system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Complementary DNA was sheared ultrasonically to ~225_bp, and each sample was run on one lane of an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using 150-bp paired-end chemistry."</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Libraries were produced with ScriptSeq kit (Illumina)</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Library construction was performed using the Illumina TruSeq  RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (RS-122-2001 and RS-122-2002).  Total RNA(100 ng to 4 ug) was the starting material and poly-A selection was NOT performed. Ribosome depletion was NOT performed.  First strand reverse transcription was accomplished using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen cat#18064-014).  Following second strand synthesis, the cDNA was converted to blunt-ends enzymatically and A-tailed. Adapters containing a T-base overhang  were ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments were PCR-amplified (12 cycles) and the amplified library is purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  Library concentration and fragment size were determined using NanoDrop, Agilent 2200 TapeStation and quantitative PCR is performed using the KapaBiosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat# KK4824) to calculate the molarity of adapter ligated library molecules.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Library pooling was done by the library concentration determined by a Kapa quant kit (Cat. KK4873). After initial pooling, a miSeq run was done using a miSeq nano kit (Cat. MS-103-1001). Pooled libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq sequencer using high-output 150-cycle kits (Cat. 20024907) to generate 2 x 75bp paired-end reads</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Library preparation followed the Titanium Rapid Library Preparation protocol. In order to improve the retention of smaller cDNA molecules, adaptor-ligated libraries were not diluted prior to size selection with AMPure XP beads. Libraries were quantified using the Titanium Slingshot kit (Fluidigm) and added to emulsion PCR reactions at 0.1 molecules per bead. Sequencing and quality control were followed manufacturer recommendations.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Library preparation was performed according to Illuminas TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol with the following modifications: The oligo-dT mRNA purification step was omitted and instead, 200ng of total RNA were directly added to the Elution2-Frag-Prime step. The PCR amplification step, which selectively enriches for library fragments that have adapters ligated on both ends, was performed according to the manufacturers recommendation but the number of amplification cycles was reduced to 12. Each library was uniquely tagged with one of Illuminas TruSeq LT RNA barcodes to enable library pooling for sequencing.The finished libraries were quantitated using Invitrogens Picogreen assay and the average library size was determined on a Bioanalyzer 2100, using a DNA 7500 chip (Agilent). Library concentrations were then normalized to 4nM and validated by qPCR on a ViiA-7 real-time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), using qPCR primers recommended in Illuminas qPCR protocol, and Illuminas PhiX control library as standard. The libraries were then pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced in one lane on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer in rapid mode at a read-length of 100bp paired-end.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Nearshore surface, offshore surface and offshore deep (hypolimnetic) Lake Michigan water was collected in September 2015 and used to set up ~3 L triplicate mesocosms that either received 120 micromolar terrestrially-derived dissolved organic matter (tDOM) or were left unamended (control). The mesocosms were incubated in the dark and subsampled for ~1 L water at 2 h and 19 h to collect free-living prokaryotic cells. These cells were then used for whole-community DNA and RNA extraction using phenol-chloroform based organic extraction in the lab. For this library, total RNA from the triplicate control mesocosms (19 h time-point) set up using nearshore surface lake-water was pooled and used for metatranscriptomic sequencing. Briefly, the pooled total RNA was first enriched for mRNA by ribosomal RNA depletion using Illumina's Ribo-Zero bacteria kit, and the enriched mRNA was subsequently used for cDNA synthesis and library prep using Takara Bio's SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq kit.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Nucleic acid extraction was performed automatically using the QIASymphony Virus dsp pathogen kitand 200l primary material. RNA Illumina NGS libraries were prepared from each sample usingSMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 - Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio Europe, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France). All libraries were multiplex-sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq or MiSeqinstrument (300 cycles, PE protocol).</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) were simultaneously extracted from each of the two samples using a phenol:chloroform protocol and mechanical shearing (Urich et al., 2008). To account for differences in extraction efficiencies between easily- and difficultly lysed cells, bead-beating was performed at two different speeds in the Fast-Prep instrument (4 and 5 m/s). The triplicate extractions at both conditions were later on merged into one nucleic acid pool per sample. After DNase treatment and RNA purification using MegaClear columns (Ambion), the success of the DNase treatment was verified by PCR with 16S rRNA primers specific for bacteria and archaea. Subsequently, total RNA was subjected to double-stranded cDNA synthesis as previously described (Urich et al., 2008). Shotgun sequencing of the HMW DNA and the two cDNA preparations was performed on a GS FLX pyrosequencer (Margulies et al., 2005) using Titanium chemistry at the Norwegian High-throughput Sequencing Centre located at the University of Oslo, Norway. All sequencing reads shorter than 150 bp were removed as well as those containing degenerate bases (&#x2018;Ns&#x2019;) or an average quality score below 25</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>On Jan. 2017, to investigate the virome of wildgeese species in the Wetland park in Heilongjiang and Qinghai, 54 fecal samples were collected from two different provinces, China. All samples were collected by disposable materials. About 1g fecal sample were re-suspended in 0.5mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vigorously vortexed for 5 min.The supernatants were then collected after centrifugation (10 min, 15,000g). 500 l of each supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-m filter (Millipore) to remove eukaryotic and bacterial cell-sized particles. The filtrates enriched in viral particles were treated with DNase and RNase to digest unprotected nucleic acid at 37C for 90 min. Remaining total nucleic acid was then isolated using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. 5 libraries were then constructed using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform with 250 bases paired ends with dual barcoding for each pool. For bioinformatics analysis, paired-end reads of 250 bp generated by MiSeq were debarcoded using vendor software from Illumina.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Our method, RNAtag-Seq, utilizes a molecular barcoding strategy that generates multiple libraries in a single reaction, lowers labor and reagent costs per sample, and produces data on prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples that are comparable to those generated by traditional strand-specific RNA-seq approaches. Barcoding in RNAtag-Seq is achieved through direct ligation of adaptors to RNA, enabling high quality, strand-specific, quantitative sequencing of full-length transcripts in diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic species.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>P. asymbioticus (strain QLW-P1DMWA-1, Hahn et al. (2016b)) was co-cultured with single- and multi-species chrysophyte communities containing the species Chlorochromonas danica (strain 933-7, Pringsheim (1955)), Poterioochromonas malhamensis (strain DS, Boenigk et al. (2006) and Poteriospumella lacustris (strain JBM10, Findenig et al. (2010)) Precultures of the axenic chrysophyte species were grown at 15 C in NSY (nutrient broth, soytone, yeast extract) medium (Hahn et al., 2004). Cultures were illuminated with 75-100 E light intensity and a light:dark cycle of 16:8 h. For the experiment, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min at 20 C and washed in modified DY-V medium (pH 6, Andersen (2007)). P. asymbioticus was cultivated in inorganic basal medium (NSY medium supplemented with 3 g/l of each of nutrient broth, soytone and yeast extract) under continuous shaking at room temperature. Prior to the experiment, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 10 min at 20 C and washed three times with DY-V (pH 6) medium. For the experiment, all samples were inoculated with the chrysophytes at the same biovolume, corresponding to approx. 4702505 m3/ml in total for each treatment and 30 million bacteria per ml, which amounts to an approx. 1000-fold higher bacterial cell number than chrysophyte cells. Experiments were run in 3 replicates for 24 h in modified DY-V (pH 6) medium under the same settings as above.  RNA extraction was carried out under sterile conditions using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland{protocol modified). Prior to the RNA extraction the stabilization solution was removed from the filters. In brief, filters were ground in liquid nitrogen and incubated for 15 min in TRIzol at 15 C. Chloroform was added, shaken vigorously and incubated for 15 min at 15 C. The mixture was centrifuged to achieve separation of phases. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new reaction tube and RNA was precipitated using isopropanol (incubation for 1h at -20 C and centrifugation). The RNA pellet was washed three times in 75% ethanol and re-suspended in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) water. Sequencing was performed at the sequencing provider BGI (Hong Kong). They performed quality control of the samples, rRNA depletion, library preparation and paired-end sequencing of the RNA with a read length of 100 bp on the Illumina HiSeq 4000. Upon sequencing the data was filtered to remove adapter sequences, contaminations and low-quality reads from the raw reads.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

The biofilm/RNAProtect-suspensions for each replicate were immediately mixed by vortexing for 5 s and incubated in room temperature for 5 min prior to centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 x g following manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. The pelleted biofilms were stored at -80&#xB0;C for one week prior to RNA extraction.  Each replicate (in total 9) was subjected to RNA extraction as follows: pelleted and frozen biofilms were thawed on ice in 350 ul lysis buffer (mirVana RNA extraction kit, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Pellet-biofilm samples representing two growth wells from the same sampling time point were pooled to generate sufficient amounts of mRNA for sequencing. For each time point 3 replicate samples were prepared. Each replicate was transferred to a bead beating tube (PowerBiofilm RNAisolation kit, MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad CA) and inserted into a Mini-bead beater (Bio Spec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Samples were homogenized twice at speed setting &#x2018;homogenize&#x2019; for 30 s. Samples were put on ice between and after beating events.  Total RNA extraction and purification was performed by using the mirVana RNA extraction kit (Life Technologies) and the RNA Clean and Concentrator&#x2122; kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), respectively. DNA was removed from the samples by adding 1 ul (2U) Turbo&#x2122; DNase (Life Technologies) and incubation in 37&#xB0;C for 30 min. After DNA removal, 16S rDNA PCR was performed by using a standard 16S amplification PCR protocol for 32 cycles of amplification to verify that DNA was removed. To remove rRNA in total RNA extracts the RiboZero&#x2122;Magnetic Kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI) was employed according to manufacturer&#x2019;s directions. mRNA was purified by using the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator&#x2122; kit (Zymo Research). RNA concentration and integrity was monitored before and after rRNA removal by using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc. Santa Clara, CA) and the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies), respectively.     mRNA library from rRNA-depleted RNA was generated by using random-primed mRNA synthesis methods according to the ScriptSeq&#x2122;v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Protocol (Epicenter). Prior to second strand mRNA synthesis the di-tagged mRNA was purified by using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (BeckmanCoulter). Index-reads supplied with the ScriptSeq Kit were added to the libraries which then were PCR amplified for 15 cycles. RNA-Seq libraries were purified and quantified by using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (BeckmanCoulter) and the Agilent DNA 1000 protocol (Agilent Technologies), respectively.

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Sea water sample</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Seawater was collected at the HOT station ALOHA (22&#x2DA;45&#x2019; N, 158&#x2DA; W) from 25 m depth at 14:00 local time six times during August and September 2012 as part of the HOE-DYLAN sampling initiative aboard the R/V Kilo Moana. Hydrocasts for sampling were performed using a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) rosette water sampler equipped with 24 Scripps 12-L sampling bottles. Water was collected in acid-washed 20-L carboys and approximately 60 L of seawater was prescreened through 200 &#xB5;m mesh and then filtered onto polycarbonate filters (5.0 &#xB5;m pore size, 47 mm, Whatman) by way of peristaltic pump. Filters were changed every 20 minutes or when flow rate decreased. Filters were placed in cryovials and stored in liquid nitrogen until mRNA extraction. Total filter time was never more than 3 hours. An incubation experiment was performed with six treatments: DSW addition, +N, +P, -N, -P, and control no addition. Triplicate 20-L carboys of each treatment were incubated at ~30% surface PAR in on-deck incubators for seven days and harvested as described above, on the seventh day at 14:00 local.         RNA was extracted from individual filters with the mRNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), following a modified version of the yeast protocol. Briefly, lysis buffer and mRNA-clean zircon beads was added to the filter and samples were vortexed for 1 minute, placed on ice for 30 seconds, and then vortexed again for 1 minute. Samples were then processed following the yeast protocol. The resulting RNA was eluted in water and then treated for possible DNA contamination using TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion) following the Rigorous DNase protocol. RNA from individual filters was then pooled by sample, using the RNA Cleanup Protocol from the mRNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The resulting mRNA sample thus represented approximately 60 L of total seawater for the in situ sample. Filters were pooled across like triplicate bottles by treatment, totaling 60 L from each of the incubation treatments. The total RNA sample was then enriched for eukaryotic mRNA through a poly-A pull down. The resulting enriched mRNA sample then went through library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq mRNA Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq2000 at Columbia Genome Center. Each sample was sequenced to produce a targeted 60 million, 100 base pair, paired end. Raw sequence data quality was visualized using FastQC and then cleaned and trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.27 (paired end mode; 6-base pair wide sliding window for quality below 20; minimum length 25 base pair).</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Sitophilus oryzae weevils are reared on wheat grains at 27.5 C and at 70 % relative humidity. The Bouriz strain was chosen in this work because it is free of any facultative symbionts, including Wolbachia, and it harbors only Sodalis pierantonius. Weevil larvae and pupae grow naturally inside the wheat grain. Fifteen insect guts per replicate were dissected from fourth instar larvae, early nymphs, nymphs and late nymphs in Buffer A (25 nM KCl, 10 nM MgCl2, 250 nM Sucrose, 35 nM Tris/HCl, pH = 7.5). Three biological replicates were performed. Tissues were pooled and stored at 80 C, prior to RNA extraction.Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturers instructions. RNA was incubated with 1 U/g of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 30 min, at 37 C then purified with RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) clean-up protocol. Total RNA concentration and quality were checked using the Qubit Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Three mature, rumen-cannulated, non-lactating Holstein x Friesian cows were used for this experiment.  Stitched nylon bags (10 cm  20 cm) of 100 m2 pore size were filled with 15 g (fresh weight) of the perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne cv. AberDart; PRG. Bags were placed simultaneously in the rumen of each cow shortly after animals were offered the first meal of the morning and removed after 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours.  At each time interval, twelve bags (four from each cow) were withdrawn and the residual plant material in six of the bags (two for each cow) was processed by washing with distilled water (500 ml added to plant material within bags and bags gently squeezed thereafter) to remove loosely attached microbes, followed by oven drying for one replicate sample from each cow and calculation of plant degradation (% dry matter lost).  The remaining six bags (two for each cow) were immediately frozen in dry ice and then stored at -80C prior to RNA extraction. Frozen samples were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen before RNA was extracted using a hot phenol method (Ougham and Davies, 1990).  Library sequencing was completed using an illumina HiSeq 2500 (illumina, California, USA) (100 bp paired end sequencing).</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Total RNA enriched for small RNA was extracted from the frozen testis sample using mirVana? miRNA Isolation Kit. The RNA 3'-adapter is specifically modified to target miRNAs and other small RNAs that have a 3'-hydroxyl group resulting from enzymatic cleavage by Dicer or other RNA processing enzymes. The adapters are ligated to each end of the RNA molecule and an RT reaction is used to create single stranded cDNA. The cDNA is then PCR amplified followed by pooled gel purification to generate library products. The library was then sequenced using Illumina HISeq. Fastx was used to remove the low quality reads and adaptors obtained from the library. The clean reads of the library was matched to the latest Sanger miRBase, not allowing mismatched bases, and other noncoding databases like ncRNA, piRNA and Rfam database with a tolerance of two mismatches using the software of CLC genomics_workbench 5.5. Sequences that did not overlap with any annotated sequence were classified as unannotated reads. Next, the annotated small RNAs varying between 18 to 35 nt were classified into several RNA categories such as the known miRNAs, precursors, tRNAs, rRNAs, misc-RNAs, mRNAs, snoRNAs/snRNAs, lincRNAs and unannotated RNAs. The software sRNA Toolkit was used to identify the novel miRNAs based on its secondary structure, the Dicer enzyme cleavage site and the minimum free energy indexs (MFEI) of the unannotated reads which could be mapped to bovine genome.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>Total RNA was extracted from the kidney cross section using NucleoSpin RNA kit. RNA quality was tested using the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer. Quantity of each total RNA was measured with a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer. Library preparation was done according to Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Guide (part # 15031047): The first step in the workflow involves purifying the poly-A containing mRNA molecules using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Strand specificity is achieved by replacing dTTP with dUTP in the Second Strand Marking Mix (SMM), followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. The incorporation of dUTP in second strand synthesis quenches the second strand during amplification, because the polymerase used in the assay is not incorporated past this nucleotide. The addition of Actinomycin D to First Stand Synthesis Act D mix (FSA) prevents spurious DNA-dependent synthesis, while allowing RNA-dependent synthesis, improving strand specificity. These cDNA fragments then have the addition of a single 'A' base and subsequent ligation of the adapter. The products are then purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. Unique Illumina TruSeq indexing adapter was ligated to this library during adapter ligation step to be able to later pool several samples in one flow cell lane. The high quality of the libraries was confirmed with Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer and the concentrations of the libraries were quantified with Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation, Life Technologies.  Only good quality libraries were sequenced. Typically the RNAseq library fragments are in the range of 200-700 bp and the average size of the fragments is 250-350 bp.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>

<DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>We sampled 21 mainland European freshwater lakes from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) to the Carpathian Mountains (Romania) and from northern Germany to the Apennines (Italy) covering a trophic gradient as well as an altitudinal range from 38 to 3110m a.s.l. All samples were taken from the edge of the water body using a telescope sampling vessel (~3m) in August 2012.  Water was filtered onto 0.2cm polycarbonate filters until the filters were blocked in order to approximate the amount of particulate matter collected per filter in the field. Once the filters fell dry after the filtration process they were immediately stabilised in RNA-stabilisation solution (LifeGuard Soil Preservation Solution, MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cooling chain was ensured by transportation in Cryo Shipper cooling vessels (Chart/MVE, Ball Ground, USA) until the samples reached Essen University laboratories. Afterwards they were stored at -80rC until further processing. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol method. RNA extraction was carried out under sterile conditions using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland ? protocol modified). Filters were ground in liquid nitrogen and incubated for 15min in TRIzol. Chloroform was added and the mixture was centrifuged to achieve separation of phases. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new reaction tube, and RNA was precipitated using isopropanol (incubation for 1h at -20rC and centrifugation). The RNA pellet was washed three times in 75% ethanol and resuspended in DEPC water. RNA integrity was checked by both gel electrophoresis and bioanalyser graphs and only samples which passed this test were used for subsequent sequencing. Our analyses focus on the relative contribution of different taxa and of different pathways. Thus, we normalised our sampling pipeline for approximately similar biomass/RNA rather than water volume as we did not aim at absolute levels of activity but at the relative composition of the RNA pool. Thus moderate deviations in the absolute amount of RNA do not affect the downstream analyses. Nevertheless, we ensured to process similar amounts of RNA per sample by a two-step process: First, in the field each filter was loaded with approximately similar amounts of particulate matter (the filtration pressure was used as a field proxy) and, second, the number of filters pooled for subsequent analyses were adjusted depending on the amount of RNA extracted per filter. This pooling further counter-balanced a potential micro-patchiness of the plankton community. The analysis thus was based on the RNA originating from approximately 1-5 billion (1-5 * 109) individuals including several million individual eukaryotes, corresponding to several hundred (highly eutrophic lakes) to several liters (oligotrophic lakes) of water. Preparation of cDNA libraries as well as sequencing was carried out using an Illumina HiSeq platform (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). Two amplified, short-insert cDNA libraries (poly-A-enriched mRNA and total RNA) with an insert size of 150-400 bp were prepared per sample, individually indexed for sequencing on HiSeq 2000, sequenced using the paired-end module (v3 chemistry) and finally demultiplexed. Libraries based on total RNA comprise predominantly rRNA fragments and therefore provide insights into the composition of the active fraction of the community whereas poly-A-enriched libraries focus on eukaryotic nucleus encoded functional genes and thereby provide deeper insights into the eukaryotic functional diversity.</DESIGN_DESCRIPTION>
