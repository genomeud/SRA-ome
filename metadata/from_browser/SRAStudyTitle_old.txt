isEBI,Phosphate addition increases tropical forest soil respiration primarily by deconstraining microbial population growth. see doi: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.11.026. Soil samples were collected from four locations in the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. Short-term laboratory incubation experiments were employed to relate soil respiration to phosphorus and oxygen and also to changes in microbial community structure and activity. Sequenced metagenomes and metatranscriptomes will be submitted under this project ID.
