Use the database version you prefer: https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2

From the link you can both see the database version you are interest (write the infos manually in the file 0_kdb_KrakenDatabase.sql) and download the inspect.txt.

The inspect.txt file contains the list of all taxons which can be found during a classification.

Example of inspect.txt download command: (copy the url of the desired database from the browser),
specifying option '-O' is possible to specify a file name:

wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/standard_16gb_20201202/inspect.txt -O Kraken2_Standard-16_2020-12-02_inspect.txt


Execute:
./getKrakenDBInfosFromInspectFile.sh <inspect.txt> <collection_name> <collection_date>

Example: ./getKrakenDBInfosFromInspectFile.sh Kraken2_DB16_inspect.txt Standard-16 2020-02-12

To produce as output the file: Kraken2_DB16_<collection_name>_<collection_date>.sql

If the file has been created successfully should have the same format of the given sql file example.

After all copy these two sql files to /sql/4_population
